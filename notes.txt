1) Issues with server validating the jwt

There is no spec for custom claims in the jwt. For ease of use purposes,
I'm adding the scopes to the jwt.

Discussion is here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/smart-on-fhir/scope$20jwt|sort:relevance/smart-on-fhir/m-iinHu5cU8/roEoWvklBwAJ

This random dude has another idea:
https://github.com/BlackPearSw/jwt-claims-fhir/blob/master/jwt-claims-fhir.md

Long story short, read here:
http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/security.html

2) Token introspection. There is no standard way to allow this. See
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12296017/how-to-validate-an-oauth-2-0-access-token-for-a-resource-server

This has a proposal for the /introspect route.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662

QUESTION: who should be allowed to introspect tokens?
